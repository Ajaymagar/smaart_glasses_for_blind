OCR with Pytesseract and OpenCV

Pytesseract is a wrapper for Tesseract-OCR Engine. It is also useful as a stand-
alone invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image types supported
by the Pillow and Leptonica imaging libraries, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp,
tiff, and others. More info about Python approach read here. The code for this
tutorial can be found in this repository.
